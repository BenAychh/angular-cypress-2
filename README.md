# CypressTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npx cypress open` and try to run the very simple test homepage.js, Cypress will complain about an error but I don't see any when I visit http://localhost:4200
